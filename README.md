# Template Engine - Employee Summary

This is the Unit 10 homework assignment for OSU Coding Bootcamp

## Project Description
This is an app that is designed to run using a CLI (command line interface) - the application is made to dynamically generate an HTML page that will display employee information for a company. The app will prompt the user to build an engineering team that consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns. This app requires Node.Js and the Inquirer package and also uses the jest package for testing. In order to use these node and the dependecies, the user will need to npm install node, inquirer and jest. 

Once installed this app can be run in Terminal using the CLI by typing node app.js (see example here):
